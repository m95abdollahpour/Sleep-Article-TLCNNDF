[**Transfer Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Sleep Stage Classification Using Two-Stage Data Fusion Framework**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9207894)


 - Run load_Sleep_EDFx.py to load an extract features from 10 ST and 10 SC recording of Sleep EDFx dataset.
 - f_vector_to_graph_images.py includes the framewrok for mapping feature vectors to Horizontal Visibility Graphs (HVG) and also for plotting draw the graphs as 2D images.
 - TLCNNDF.py includes a 2 strwam CNN which is trained using novel transfer learning method.
