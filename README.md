The implementation of the automatic sleep staging study
[**Transfer Learning Convolutional Neural Network for Sleep Stage Classification Using Two-Stage Data Fusion Framework**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9207894)


 - Run load_Sleep_EDFx.py to load and extract features from 10 ST and 10 SC recordings of the Sleep EDFx dataset.
 - f_vector_to_graph_images.py includes the framework for mapping feature vectors to Horizontal Visibility Graphs (HVG) and also for plotting the graphs as 2D images.
 - TLCNNDF.py includes a 2-strewn CNN which is trained using a novel transfer learning method.
